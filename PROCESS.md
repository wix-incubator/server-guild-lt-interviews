## Homework Assignment

_Expected time effort: 1-2 evenings_

We meet for a short face-to-face conversation. Mostly talking about Wix and you. At the end you are given a homework assignment. You pick your own technology and deadline.

Homework assignment is a small application we want you to code. Assignment is inspired by some problem we faced in the past.

Some more details available in [evaluation](./eevaluation#homework-assignment) page.

## Technical Interview

_Expected time effort: 2-3 hours_

We meet for a face-to-face conversation. You are given a problem or set of problems to solve. They cover a couple areas of being a software engineer, key focus being on system design.

Problems you are given don't have objectively correct answers. You are expected to demonstrate how effectively you are able to come up with solutions. Note that, whatever you do or say, interviewers will be questioning your decisions. In many cases - problem definition will be adjusted to see how you respond to it.

Diagrams are usually useful for communicating your ideas. However, we do not care for exact format. A couple rectangles with lines is usually enough. We care for your thought process and reasoning and not drawing skills.
