# We are looking forâ€¦
It is important to have in mind that we do not expect candidates to have same opinions and experience as we do interrnally. A lot of aspects can easily be learned as they continue working with us.

Candidates (except for juniors) are expected to do at least OK in each of critical points. Non-critical points may also be a reason to reject a candidate but only if they are really bad.

## Homework Assignment
- Clean and clear project structure (not critical).
  - There is a clear pattern to how files are structured.
  - No redundant files (such as compilation targets and user settings).
- Sufficient documentation (not critical).
  - Note: comments are considered documentation.
  - Unclear parts are documented.
  - No redundant comments (such as "loop over list of items").
- Requirements are satisfied (critical).
  - Whatever was not mentioned in the requirements - is not to be considered a violation but use common sense.
- Readable code (critical).
  - Can be understood without much time investment.
  - Includes structure and formatting.
- Simple and understandable design (critical).
  - Can be understood without much time investment.
  - No or few unnecessary units (such as questionable builders or interfaces).
- Testable design (critical).
  - Note: if it can be tested easily - it's testable.
- Tests (not critical).
  - Should cover key functionality.
  - Does not necessarily have to cover everything.
  - Level of tests (for example unit tests vs end-to-end tests) to be judged based on how fragile they are and how complicated they are to maintain compared to alternatives (assuming app design as is; design is to be evaluated separately).

## Technical Interview
- Computer science fundamentals (not critical).
  - Stack, recursion and how function calls work.
  - Algorithm complexity and how operations map to CPU and memory utilisation.
- Parallel programming (not critical).
  - Bottlenecks, context switches and how parallelisation affects performance.
  - Memory safety, race conditions, locking.
- Resilient design (critical).
  - Fallbacks.
  - Redundancy.
  - Idempotency.
- Scalable design (critical).
  - Load balancing, load distribution.
  - Data sharding.
  - Race conditions when working with data.
  - Impact of state for scalability.
- Problem solving (critical).
  - Explores alternative solutions.
  - Explores suggested solutions (if any).
  - Identifies sub-problems.
  - Identifies being stuck.
  - Identifies unknowns (at least mostly).
- Communication (critical).
  - Verbalise thought process.
- Reasoning (critical).
  - Defines key arguments for decisions made.
  - Defines key arguments against alternative or suggested options.
